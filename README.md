# Artificial-Intelligence
I took this course in my third year of university and achieved the highest possible grade. It taught me topics that included: 

Search problems - Such as frontier search, costs & heuristics and A-star. 

Learning and decision processes - Such as Q-learning & Markov decision processes deterministic case (code for the 3-node graph) uncertainty & learning, 

Constraint satisfaction problems - These included Knowledge representation, SAT, logical consequence non-monotonicity, defaults & inference. 

Bayesian and Markov networks which included topics like conditional probabilities & independence.

I have included the assignments for this course in this repo. I enjoyed programming in prolog; it was the first language where I felt like I had produced elegant code which helped inspired me to continue honing my skills.
